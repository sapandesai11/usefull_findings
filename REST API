 CRUD operation
	- GET	: this method is used for retrieving resources from server. It should be idempotent meaning no matter how many time repeated with the same parameters, it must return the result.
	- POST	: this method generally used to create a new resources on the server but not restricted to creation only. it can operate on entity as well. it is not idempotent. 
	- PUT	: this method is used for creating a new resource or updating an existing resources. it should be idempotent.
	- PATCH	: this method is used to partially(only few fields) update the entity on the server side. we can create more granular DTO with the fields to be updated for PATCH request
	- DELETE: this method is used to remove the resource from the server. it might not remove the resource immediately but it may remove asynchronously.
