Why Generics?
  It adds stability to code by adding compile time type checks.
  Generic Type is generic class or generic interface parameterized over type.
  Type parameter can be any non-primitive data type: any class type, any interface type, any array type, or even another type variable
  
Naming Convention
  Single first letter of type in upper case which is in contrast to the variable naming convention.
  
  E - Element
  K - Key
  N - Number
  T - Type
  V - Value
  S,U,V  2nd, 3rd, 4th types
