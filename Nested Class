Nested Class
  static nested class
  non-static nested class - inner class
  
Inner Class
  it can access all the instance memebers (private , public) of enclosing class directly
  you can access inner class's instance members using inner class instance
  to instantiate inner class first you have to instantiate outer class and then using outer class instance u can instantite inner class
  e.g
  class Outer{
  
    class Inner{
   
    }
    
    public static void main(Strin[] args){
      Outer o1 = new Outer();
      Inner i1 = o1.new Inner();
    
    }
  
  }
  As inner class is associated with instance of outer class, it can not have any static method
