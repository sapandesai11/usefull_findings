Component
=========
Every application has atleast one component which App or root component
 It encapsulates 
  1) data
  2) HTML template
  3) Logic
Requires 3 steps to be fully functional
  a. create
    -> export CompName(Pascle naming convention)
  b. register
    -> make an entry of CopmName in declarations array in app.module.ts file
  c. use
    -> user selector inside template for app component
 Instead of writing boiler plate code for creating comp, we can use angular CLI.
 ng g c copmname    
 P.S loo at the naming convention
  
Modules
=======
It is group of related components. Every application has atleast one module which is called App modules.
As application scales we want to breake into smaller and reusable modules.

Template
========
String Interpolation
